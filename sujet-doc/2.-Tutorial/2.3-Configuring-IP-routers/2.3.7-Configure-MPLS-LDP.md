## MPLS Overview

**MPLS** (multi-protocol label switching) is a forwarding protocol that enables forwarding of data within a network. The peculiarity of MPLS is that the latter allows forwarding of data packets according to a label value, instead of a destination IP address. In short, a label 
is added to the packets when they enter the network. Within the network, the packet is forwarded _solely_ according to this label value.

The label value added within the packet depends on the _FEC_ (Forwarding Equivalence Class) of the packet. Each FEC is associated with a given label, which will dictate the path that the packet will take within the network. Once it possesses a label, the packet is said to enter an _MPLS tunnel_, or _LSP_ (label switched path). Packets within the same FEC will follow the tunnel (as they will receive the same label). In practice, the FEC of a packet is often its destination address. The association between a label and an FEC is _local_: a label loses its meaning when it reaches the next router, which may have chosen a different label for the same FEC. Thus, a router has to advertise its FEC-to-label correspondences to its peers. This is performed through _LDP_ (label distribution protocol). 

The exact way the labels are distributed depends on the hardware. In particular, there exists an _ordered_ and an _unordered_ way to distribute the labels. In this unordered method, all routers start to advertise its FEC to label correspondence for all the prefixes it knows, even if the destination itself has not advertised any label bindings yet. Thus, the construction of the tunnel starts with no guarantee that the latter will reach the destination. In the _ordered_ method, the destination advertises the FEC to label binding first. Only upon receiving the corresponding advertisement do the next router creates its own mapping, before advertising it. Thus, the tunnel is created step by step, starting from the destination. The label-switching commutation begins and is stable once every router has advertised its own FEC-to-label correspondence.


When a packet enters the network, the first router (the ingress) computes the FEC of the packet. Once determined, the associated label is added (or _pushed_) between the layer 2 and layer 3 information (hence why MPLS is usually referred to as a _layer 2.5 protocol_). Once the packet is labeled, the packet is forwarded solely according to its label. It is said to enter an MPLS _tunnel_ or an _LSP_ (Label Switch Path). 


Along this label switched path (LSP) only the label information is considered when forwarding the packet. Since the association between an FEC and a label is local, each router _swaps_ the current label with the one advertised by the next router for the given FEC (so that the label makes sense for the next router within the LSP). At the end of the LSP, the label should be removed. Thus, the last (or penultimate) router within the LSP removes (or _pops_) the label. The router that removes the label marks the end of the LSP/tunnel and is referred to as the _egress_.  In practice, reserved labels values are associated with the pop operation: if the label holds the value 3 or 0, the latter should be removed from the packet.

The following figure illustrates how MPLS with LDP operates within a network.

Note that this example is (very) oversimplified and thus not completely representative of the actual behavior of LDP. In particular, the latter is reminiscent of an _ordered_ LDP advertising, and not a _unordered_ one, which would be far more chaotic.

Here, we focus on a single prefix, `P2`, which is configured on the loopback of `EGR`. EGR, 
being directly connected to `P2` starts by stating through LDP that it associates P2 to the label `imp null` (a specific reserved value). In other words, if `R2` wants to send traffic towards `P2` to `EGR` through an MPLS tunnel, `R2` should use the label `imp null` so that `EGR` forwards the traffic to the correct next-hop. `R2` can now continue to expand the tunnel leading to `P2`. `R2` can now advertise to `R1` that it associated the destination `P2` to the label `15`. If `R1` wants `R2` to send traffic towards `P2` through an MPLS tunnel, the latter should be tagged with the label `15`. 


<p align="center">
<img src="uploads/MPLS.PNG" width="600"/>
</p>


Once the labels are set up, the figure above illustrates how the actual forwarding takes place within the established LSP/tunnel. Once `ING` receives traffic from `SRC` to  `P2`, it associates it with an FEC (here, the destination `P2` is also the FEC). `ING` then checks within its LDP table which label `R1` associated with destination `P2`. Here, the label `R1` associated to `P2` is `29`. Thus, `ING`_pushes_ the label `29` onto the packet. Upon receiving the packet, `R1` thus knows that the destination is `P2`. It then checks with its label forwarding table how the label value should be updated, according to the LDP advertisement made by `R2`. It thus swaps the label `29` for the label `15`. This is repeated along the LSP, until the label is POPed by the last or penultimate router within the LSP. 


:pencil2: **Note:** By default, routers will start creating tunnels to _all_ the destinations within their RIB, except BGP prefixes.



MPLS is widely deployed within operators' networks for various reasons, regarding both costs and performances. Additionally, using MPLS tags is used in various technologies such as BGP MPLS VPN or Segment Routing. In particular, one may configure MPLS tunnels that deviate from the standard shortest paths, in order to route specific traffic through specific routes (e.g., going through a firewall or following a route with a lower delay). 


### Activate LDP

:warning: Ensure that the loopback of all routers are within a **/32** prefix, and that the 
corresponding prefix advertised within OSPF is a /32 as well. For example, the loopback of 
the `BROO` router should be `X.151.0.1/32`, and advertised within OSPF as `network X.151.0.1/32 area 0`.

LDP may be activated simply by issuing the `mpls ldp` command and associating a router-id to the router. Configure the router-id as the loopback address.

```
router# conf t
router(config)# mpls ldp
router(config-ldp)# router-id 18.158.0.1
```

Within the `config-ldp` menu, one may specify the interfaces LDP should be enabled on, and the address the router should use as a source when sending LDP control packets.

```
router(config-ldp)# address-family ipv4
router(config-ldp-af)# discovery transport-address 18.158.0.1
```

The above snippet configures the source address that should be used when sending LDP control messages. It is highly recommended to configure the loopback of the router as the `discovery transport-address`.

Finally, one may activate LDP on the necessary interfaces.

```
router(config-ldp)# address-family ipv4
router(config-ldp-af)# interface [int1]
router(config-ldp-af-if)# exit
router(config-ldp-af)# interface [int2]
...
```

:warning: Only interfaces which have to send LDP messages to other peers should appear. For example, there is no point in interfaces connected to hosts to send LDP control messages.

### Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) and Ultimate Hop Popping (UHP)

PHP and UHP are two operating modes in MPLS-enabled routers.

With PHP, the router being the penultimate hop for a particular FEC will remove the outermost label of an MPLS packet.

With UHP, the router being the ultimate hop for a particular FEC will remove the outermost label of an MPLS packet.

The following command allows to enable UHP within a router. De-activate it by prepending it with _no_ enables PHP. Note that this is performed from the `mpls ldp address-family ipv4` submenu.

```
router(config-ldp-af)# label local advertise explicit-null
```

### IP TTL Propagation

The way a router handles the IP (and MPLS) TTL when a packet enters a tunnel depending on the TTL propagation parameter. The latter may be set or unset. Currently, FRR does not support the tuning of this parameter within the cli. However, the latter can be modified within the underlying container which is running FRR. 

:warning: For now, only `STLO` and `NEWY` support such modifications. 

First, you need to access the container of the router :

```
root@g8-proxy: ./goto.sh STLO container
```

From the container, you may read the current setup of the TTL propagation (here, is it activated).: 

```
 - - To consult current ttl propagation option  - -
root@STLO_router:~# sysctl net.mpls.ip_ttl_propagate
net.mpls.ip_ttl_propagate = 1
```

You can then modify the TTL propagation setup through the following: 

```
 - - To activate ttl propagation option  - -
root@STLO_router:~# sysctl -w net.mpls.ip_ttl_propagate=1

 - - To deactivate ttl propagation option  - -
root@STLO_router:~# sysctl -w net.mpls.ip_ttl_propagate=0
```

### Debugging

You can easily check on which interface LDP was activated: 
```
router# show mpls ldp ipv4 interface
AF   Interface   State  Uptime   Hello Timers  ac
ipv4 lo          ACTIVE 01:13:26 5/15           1
```

Another useful command is `show mpls ldp ipv4 discovery detail`, which allows to check the configuration of ldp (discovery address, router id interfaces...) in a single command.

The known LDP neighbors can be shown through the following command. Use this command to ensure that the LDP sessions have been established correctly.

```
router(config)# show mpls ldp neighbor
AF   ID              State       Remote Address    Uptime
ipv4 1.1.1.1         OPERATIONAL 1.1.1.1         00:01:37
```

Here, the local router has an operational LDP neighbor which has the ID 1.1.1.1.

One may also see the LDP binding (i.e., which label is associated to a given FEC/Destination for the local router):

```
router(config)# show mpls ldp ipv4 binding
AF   Destination          Nexthop         Local Label Remote Label  In Use
ipv4 1.1.1.1/32           1.1.1.1         16          imp-null         yes
ipv4 3.3.3.3/32           2.2.2.2         18          29               yes

```

Here, for the destination `1.1.1.1`, the next hop is `1.1.1.1` (i.e., the router is locally connected to `1.1.1.1`). The label the local router expects for traffic targeting  `1.1.1.1` is `16`. The latter should be swapped for the value `imp-null` before being sent to `1.1.1.1`.

Similarly, for destination `3.3.3.3`, the next hop is `2.2.2.2`. For traffic targeting `2.2.2.2`, the local router expects the label value `18`. However, `2.2.2.2` expects the value `29` (known through LDP). Thus, the label `18` should be swapped with `29` before forwarding the packet to `2.2.2.2`.

The association destination-label can be seen through the `show ip route command`:

```
router# show ip route
Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP,
       O - OSPF, I - IS-IS, B - BGP, E - EIGRP, N - NHRP,
       T - Table, v - VNC, V - VNC-Direct, A - Babel, D - SHARP,
       F - PBR,
       > - selected route, * - FIB route

O>* 1.1.1.1/32 [110/120] via 10.115.0.1, eth2, label 16, 00:00:15
O>* 2.2.2.2/32 [110/20] via 10.115.0.1, eth2, label implicit-null, 00:00:15
O>* 10.200.0.0/24 [110/210] via 10.115.0.1, eth2, label 17, 00:00:15
```

Finally, you can also look at the MPLS table (LFIB) using show mpls table:

``` 
router# show mpls table
 Inbound Label  Type  Nexthop  Outbound Label
 ----------------------------------------------
 16             LDP   1.0.2.2  17
 17             LDP   1.0.1.2  implicit-null
 18             LDP   1.0.2.2  19
```
