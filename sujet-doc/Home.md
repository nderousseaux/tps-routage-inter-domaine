Welcome to the mini_internet_project wiki!

Mini_internet is a tool which aims at showing you the interaction and configurations 
behind operators networks within the Internet, at a manageable scale. In this mini-internet, 
each group has its own AS to configure in order to ensure global connectivity across all devices of the mini-internet by the end of the project.

On the right side of your screen, you'll find the sidebar which will allow you to navigate the different sections. Be sure to correctly read the assignment part in its entirety before starting the project.

During the project, be sure to check the Tutorial folder. It's there to help you 
configure your FRR routers.

The tool was originally created and designed by the ETH Zurich as part of their Communication Networks course. You can find the article describing the platform here: 
[An Open Platform to Teach How the Internet Practically Works](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3402413.3402420)

The best way to start is to read the first Section of this wiki : A brief introduction, before moving on to the assignment. 

Good luck !
