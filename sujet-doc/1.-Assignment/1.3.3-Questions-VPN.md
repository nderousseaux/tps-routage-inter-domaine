In this part of the assignment, you will set up BGP VPNs over MPLS. More precisely,
two companies, X (in purple) and Y (in orange), are your customers. The latter possesses several sites where their companies are located. They do not want access to the Internet, but to connect their distant sites through _your_ network.

To correctly provide this VPN service, you must allow X sites to communicate with one another. Similarly, each Y site (i.e. office locations) should be able to communicate with all other Y sites. However, be careful: X should not be able to communicate with Y, and Y should not be able to communicate with X.

The service has to be transparent to your customer. In other words, there is no complex configuration on their end: they configure their routers as if they were directly connected, agnostically to your network. All of the VPN-specific configurations are to be performed on your routers.

X has a site connected to `NEWY`, one to `BROO` and another `NASH`, whereas Y has a site connected to `NEWY` and one to `STLO`.
Those sites are represented on the L3 topology.
Each site is designed by the notation `{COMPANY}{ROUTER}`, where COMPANY is the name of the company and ROUTER is the name of the router the site is connected to.
For example, the site of company Y connected to the `STLO` router is designated by `YSTLO`.

#### :warning: Before starting :warning:

**CEs were (wrongly) pre-configured. To start, remove the configuration from all the CE routers (YSTLO, YNEWY, XNASH, XBROO, XNEWY). You should remove BGP and OSPF from the CE routers, as well as most of the IP addresses (see the mini-internet Figure).
You should also remove OSPF and IPs on both sides of the CE-PE link. For OSPF and BGP, a simple “no router ospf” and “no router bgp” is sufficient. You may also have to remove addresses on hosts.**

**You will also have to re-configure BGP on `NEWY`. Through the following:**
```
router bgp X
 neighbor X.151.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.151.0.1 update-source lo
 neighbor X.153.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.153.0.1 update-source lo
 neighbor X.154.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.154.0.1 update-source lo
 neighbor X.155.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.155.0.1 update-source lo
 neighbor X.156.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.156.0.1 update-source lo
 neighbor X.157.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.157.0.1 update-source lo
 neighbor X.158.0.1 remote-as X
 neighbor X.158.0.1 update-source lo
```

:notebook: As per usual, you will submit your report and configs through moodle. Your report and configs for MPLS **and** VPNs have to be **submitted by 01/04**. The deposit will be made available in due time.


#### Question 1.1 (1 points)

Before configuring the VPNs, you must configure IP addresses on every router belonging to X and Y.

Configure the IP addresses on the interfaces of your routers towards your customers, and your customer’s routers interfaces. Configure the hosts as well. You must use the IP addresses shown in the L3 topology. Ensure that each host can ping the router it is directly connected to.


#### Question 1.2 (1 points)

The iBGP sessions in your AS are already configured.
However, iBGP sessions between PEs still miss the settings for carrying VPN information. To carry such information, routers must use MP-BGP.

Activate MP-BGP between the _relevant_ PEs.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Add the relevant excerpt of the `sh ip bgp summary` and `sh bgp ipv4 vpn` commands. What do you observe, and how do you interpret your configuration at this stage of the process?


#### Question 1.3 (1 points)

On the PE, create a VRF for each VPN, and bind the corresponding relevant interface(s) to the created VRF.

:warning: The VRFs on `BROO` and `NASH` have already been configured for your convenience.
Therefore, you only need to configure VRFs on `NEWY` and `STLO`.

For company X, we will use the VRF name `VRF_X`, and for company Y we will use `VRF_Y`.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Add the relevant excerpts of the `ip link` and `sh int brief` commands when launched from the STLO/NEWY containers and routers.


#### Question 1.4 (2 points)

Company Y wants to use static routes between their different sites. Before setting up the VPN, some static routes are necessary. More precisely, each PE should possess a static route to the business site it’s connected to. The CE, on the other hand, should possess a default route through its PE (as all non-local addresses are behind it).

Configure these static routes on the CE and PE of the VPN Y. Be careful, as these routes are specific to a given VRF for the PE (see tutorial).

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Show the output of `show bgp ipv4 vpn` on `STLO`. What do you observe?


#### Question 1.5 (3 points)

Your next step is to configure route delivery settings between your VRF route tables and the regular routing table. In particular, the (static) routing knowledge for the given VPN should be distributed among all PEs (see tutorial). Choose your route targets to create a mesh topology. Explain how the route targets you have chosen fulfill the conditions of a full mesh.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Add the relevant excerpt of the BGP table on `NEWY`, and the relevant excerpts of the BGP table for the VRF. Add the relevant excerpt of `NEWY`’s MPLS table. Also show the output of `sh ip route` from `YSTLO`.


#### Question 1.6 (1 points)

After the last step, your VPNs should be up. Show the connectivity between the sites of company Y by pinging the host of `YNEWY` from the host of `YSTLO`.
Next, try to ping the loopback of `YNEWY` from `YSTLO`. If you have configured your VPNs correctly, you should observe that the `ping` shows no connectivity. Why? Explain how you found your answer.


#### Question 1.7 (2 points)

Go on the `STLO` _container_ and launch a tcpdump on its interface towards `PITT`. Next, go on the host of `YSTLO` and launch a ping towards the host of `YNEWY`. Comment the tcpdump output. In particular, explain the MPLS labels that you can see on top of the corresponding ICMP packets (echo reply _and_ echo request) and their purpose.

Thanks to the MPLS commands you know and the `show ip route vrf VRF_Y`, explain how the MPLS labels evolve along the path from one site to the other. 


#### Question 1.8 (3 points)

In opposition, company X has decided to connect their different sites through OSPF.
In this case, the PE gains the routing knowledge towards the site it is connected to by sharing an OSPF adjacency with the latter. 

In other words, the CE advertises through OSPF its loopback and its host network. The PE, which shares an OSPF adjacency with its CE, learns the routes through OSPF. The routes learned are then redistributed through MP-BGP to the other PEs. The other PEs, in turn, redistribute the said routes within the OSPF of their clients. 

:warning: Note that the OSPF run by the company is distinct from the OSPF run by your AS. The OSPF routes learned through your CE should not appear within your own OSPF routes, but should remain within their own, distinct VRF table.

Start by configuring OSPF between your AS and company X by establishing OSPF adjacencies between your routers (PEs) and your customer’s routers (CE). Ensure that the CE advertises its loopback as well as its host network.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Add the relevant excerpt of `show bgp ipv4 vpn` from the PE.




#### Question 1.9 (4 points)

You now need to configure route delivery settings between your VRF route tables and the regular routing table, this time considering OSPF instead of static routes.

Choose your route targets to create a full-mesh topology.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Add the relevant excerpt of the BGP table on `NEWY`, and the relevant excerpts of the BGP table for the VRF. Show the connectivity between the sites of company X by pinging from the host of `NASH` to the host of `BROO`. Also show that the sites of company X can’t ping the sites of company Y. Include the output of `sh ip route`  from `XNEWY`.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Show a traceroute from the host of `NASH` to the host of `NEWY`. Comment the output of the traceroute. What path do the packets take?


#### Question 1.10 (2 points)

Company X wants to change the design of its VPN. Rather than having a meshed topology, they want all traffic to go through `NEWY`, their headquarters. Tune the route-target of the VPN so that the VPN of company X now follows a hub and spoke topology, with `NEWY` the hub.

:bulb: To create a hub and spoke, spokes should only learn their routes directly from the hub (and not from other spokes). Thus, spoke-to-spoke traffic necessarily goes through the hub (as they learned their routes from it).

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain your choice of route-targets. Study the connectivity between all sites of company X. Can each site talk to all other sites ? Why ?


#### Question 1.11 (bonus 1 points)

How could we enable connectivity between all sites of company X?


#### Question 1.12 (bonus 4 points)

Enable the connectivity between all sites of company X. Are the paths taken from two spokes optimal ?
