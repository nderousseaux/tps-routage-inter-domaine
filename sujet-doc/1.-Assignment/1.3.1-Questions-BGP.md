The assignment is split in the following three parts:

1.  [Intra-domain routing](#intra-domain-routing-4-points). In the first part you establish connectivity within your network (intra-domain).

2.  [Inter-domain routing](#inter-domain-routing-15-point).  The second part is all about interconnecting all the networks
    (inter-domain). It involves configuring your iBGP sessions, bringing your eBGP sessions with your neighboring ASes up and advertising your prefixes. 

3.  [Policy routing](#policy-routing-45-points-05-bonus-points). The third and last part involves implementing your BGP policies according to 
    the business relationships that you have with your neighbors. 

To help you with project, we explain in the tutorial section how to configure your [hosts](../2.-Tutorial/2.2-Configuring-a-host) as well as [routers](../2.-Tutorial/2.3-Configuring-IP-routers/2.5.1-The-FRRouting-CLI).
For each question, we precisely tell you what you must include in your report. Take a close look at the [submission instructions](../1.-Assignment/1.1-General-Instructions#submission-instructions) to see how you should submit your work. 

:pencil: 3 points are dedicated to the report itself. Among other things, such as spelling and grammar, ensure that the latter respects the instructions mentioned in the assignment instructions section.

### Intra-Domain Routing (3 points)


_Hint:_ Use `traceroute` with the option `-n` to prevent traceroute from trying to translate the IP addresses while the DNS isn't configured.

#### Question 1.1 (1.5 point)

Configure OSPF network-wide by establishing OSPF adjacencies between neighboring
routers. Then, make sure to advertise all your IPv4 subnets into OSPF so as to enable end-to-end connectivity between all the **hosts** in your AS.

Before configuring OSPF, you will have to configure all the IP
addresses on each interface of your routers and their directly connected host. You **must** use the IP addresses shown in the [L3 topology](1.2-Your-mini-Internet#l3-topology).
You receive a /8 for your AS, in the form: X.0.0.0/8 where X is your group number. The prefix allocation is given in the topology. 

> Do not modify the `dns` interface on `DETR`, the `measurement` interface on `NASH`, and the `matrix` interface on `CHAR`. 

> For now, it is not required to configure the `portCEX/CEY` interfaces and devices. You may simply ignore them.

_For the router interfaces between `PITT` and `DETR`, for example, you have to use the
subnet `X.0.7.0/24`. The interface in `PITT` that is connected to `DETR` must have
the IP address `X.0.7.1` and the interface in `DETR` that is connected to `PITT` must
have the IP address `X.0.7.2` (where X is your group number)._

_Every router also has a loopback interface with the name `lo` that you have to configure. The router
with ID Y has the loopback address `X.[150+Y].0.1/24` where X is your group number
(router IDs are shown on each router, for example the ID of `CHIC` is 6).
As an example, the loopback address of the router `CHIC` for the group 10 is
`10.156.0.1/24`._

_For the connection between the routers and their corresponding host,
you have to use the subnet `X.[100+Y].0.0/24`, where X is your group number,
and Y is the ID of the router. Then, the host gets the IP address `X.[100+Y].0.1` and the
interface of the router that is connected to this host will have the IP address
`X.[100+Y].0.2`. For example, the subnet used for group 15 between the `CHAR` router and 
the corresponding host is `15.103.0.0/24`. The interface at the router `CHAR` that is 
connected to the host, is called `host` and uses `15.103.0.2/24`. The interface 
of the host connected to the router is called `CHARrouter` and uses the IP address `15.103.0.1/24`._

**Be sure that each host can ping its directly connected router. Then,
you can start configuring OSPF.**

When configuring OSPF, verify that the subnet of the DNS server and the measurement
container are visible in OSPF (for instance with `show ip route ospf`). 
We give more detail about the DNS server and the measurement container in the [tools](1.4-Tools-to-help-you) section.


From now on, always prefer to launch
`traceroute` from the hosts because they can use the DNS service (routers cannot).
If one host cannot access the DNS server because the OSPF configuration is not ready
yet, run `traceroute` with the option `-n` so that it does not
try to translate each IP address found on the path.

If the DNS server does work, you can use the targets hostnames for simplicity. The hostnames follow a specific naming scheme.
As an example, tracerouting to the host linked to the PITT router within AS 10 would be done through `traceroute host-PITT.group10`. Tracerouting the PITT interface of the PITT-DETR link can be done through `traceroute PITT-DETR.group10`.


:pencil: **To include in your report:** Include the result of a `traceroute` from `CHAR-host` to `DETR-host`.

#### Question 1.2 (1.5 point)

As a network operator, your goal is now to provide the best performance to your
customers. Here in particular, you expect a lot of traffic between provider 1
which is connected to `CHIC` and customer 1 which is connected to `NASH`. Besides, 
the links `STLO`-`PITT` and `PITT`-`NEWY` should be used only as backup, in case another link in your network fails.

To do so, you must configure OSPF weights such that the traffic between `CHIC` and `NASH` is
loadbalanced on the following three paths (and only those ones): `CHIC`-`STLO`-`NASH`, `CHIC`-`DETR`-`PITT`-`NASH` and 
`CHIC`-`DETR`-`BROO`-`NEWY`-`CHAR`-`NASH`, and this for both directions.
Then, you must also configure OSPF weights such that the links `STLO`-`PITT` and `PITT`-`NEWY` 
are only used as backup. 

<p align="center">
<img src="uploads/b54a5efa3c289ab8841b558a08030a36/loadbalancing.png" width="600"/>
</p>

:pencil: **To include in your report:** List all the OSPF weights you
used. Then, include the results of a `traceroute` from `CHIC-host` to 
`NASH-host` and from `NEWY-host` to `STLO-host`. Comment the results of your `traceroutes`: 
do you see what you expect according to the weights you have configured, why?


### Inter-Domain Routing (5.5 points)

#### Question 2.1 (2.5 points)

Configure internal BGP sessions (iBGP) between all pairs of routers (full-mesh).
Verify that each one of your routers does have an iBGP session with all the other routers with
the command `show ip bgp summary`.

When you establish a BGP session, you must use the loopback
address for each endpoint of the connection. The loopback address is a virtual
address that is always up as long as the router is running. Using the loopback
interface instead of any other physical interface prevents the BGP session to go down
if a physical interface becomes unavailable.
To use loopback addresses for your BGP sessions, you will have to use the
`update-source` command when you configure the internal BGP sessions.
We explain why and how to configure it in our FRRouting tutorial.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain what `update-source` does
and why you have to use it. Show the result of a `show ip bgp summary` for the router `NASH`.

#### Question 2.2 (3 points)

Configure the external BGP sessions (eBGP) with your neighboring ASes (including the IXPs).
We provide you these IP addresses
alongside the information about where and with whom you are
supposed to have an eBGP session. You can find this information in the [inter-as-connection](http://mini-internet-mai.u-strasbg.fr/inter-as-connections) file. 
For every eBGP session, the file shows its type (Peer-Peer, Customer-Provider or Provider-Customer),
which router is connected to the neighboring AS, and what IP address (and subnet) you should
use for the interface in __your__ router.
The snapshot of the file below is a partial example of what the AS connections file
tells you if you are group 3 (AS 3).

```
3	CHIC	Customer	1	BROO	Provider	179.0.3.2/24

```


Based on this snapshot, we can see that AS3 (first column) is the customer of AS1 (fourth column). The router `CHIC` of AS3 is connected to the router `BROO` of AS 1, its provider. Thus, there exists a link between the `CHIC` router of AS3 and the `BROO` router of AS1. 
You must configure the IP address `179.0.3.2/24` on the interface of `CHIC` connected to the router `BROO` of AS1. You may find the address of your neighbor (i.e., the address of the interface of `BROO` within AS1) by looking at the corresponding line in the file. As `BROO` is within AS1, the address of its interface has to be configured by group 1.


```
3	BROO	Peer	81	IXP81	Peer	180.81.0.3/24

```

This shows that AS3 is also connected to the IXP81 via its router `BROO`. Similarly to the case described above, you must configure the IP address `180.81.0.3/24` on the interface of `BROO` connected to the IXP.
In our Internet, the AS number of an IXP is its identification number.
For example, IXP126 has the AS number 126. The IP address of the IXP
route server is `180.Z.0.Z` with Z the IXP number. The route server
of IXP126, for example, has the IP address `180.126.0.126`.

> By default, we have configured the IXPs to not relay your BGP advertisements to
their other peers. Thus, it is normal if you do not see your prefixes advertised through the IXP. We will take care of that in question 3.2.

Once the eBGP sessions are up, advertise your prefix to your peers.
You must only advertise the /8 that has been assigned to you.
In the meantime, your peers should advertise to you their /8 prefix,
as well as all the /8 prefixes they have learned (since there are no BGP policies yet).

> [Recall](../2.-Tutorial/2.3-Configuring-IP-routers/2.3.5-Configure-BGP) that you will need to configure a static route to Null0 for your /8 prefix, otherwise your routers won't advertise your /8 prefix with BGP. 

:bulb: To answer this question, you will have to use the `next-hop-self`
command when you configure the external BGP sessions. We explain why and how to
configure it in our [FRRouting tutorial](../2.-Tutorial/2.3-Configuring-IP-routers/2.3.5-Configure-BGP).

**Reminder**: The IP address of the IXP Route Server is `180.Z.0.Z` with Z the IXP number.

> To check whether a BGP session is working and a connection has been established,
> you can use the command `show ip bgp summary`. You will see a list of all BGP neighbors. If there
> is a time entry in the column `Up/Down`, then the session has successfully been established.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** 
Explain what `next-hop-self` does and why you have to use it using an example in your own network.
Also, explain on which BGP sessions `next-hop-self` is required.
Then, show us the results of a `show ip bgp` for the router `CHAR`. You should see the prefixes
advertised by your neighboring ASes, which would indicate that your eBGP sessions
are correctly configured and that the advertisements are correctly propagated through
your iBGP sessions.
Then, show us that your neighboring ASes do receive the advertisement for your
/8 prefix. To do that, show in your report the result of the looking glass for
one router located in a neighboring AS. You should see your prefix in the looking glass.
Finally, show us that you have data-plane connectivity with your neighbors by
showing the result of a `traceroute` from your `PITT-host`
to the `PITT-host` of one of your neighboring ASes.

:information_source: Tier1 ASes do not have a router in `PITT`. Thus, if your are connected to a Tier1 AS, you should launch the `traceroute` towards your customers. 

### Policy Routing (8.5 points)

#### Question 3.1 (4 points)

Configure your local-preference as well as the exportation rules to implement
the customer/provider and peer/peer business relationships with your
neighbors (see the Gao-Rexford [paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/cs268-2019/papers/gao-rexford.pdf)).
The connections you have through your IXP must be
considered as peer-to-peer connections.

> Keep in mind that the default behaviour of the IXP Route Server is to not relay the BGP advertisements, thus  for now the prefixes you advertise to your IXP will not be propagated to the other IXP's participants. Yet, you can already configure the exportation rules for the eBGP session you have with your IXP. We will verify that it works in question 3.2.

:bulb: To configure the exportation rules, you can tag incoming routes using BGP
communities to keep track of where the routes have been learned,
and then match on the tag when exporting the routes.
We advice you to verify with `traceroutes` or with the looking glass
that the paths used do respect the business relationships.

:bulb: Do not forget to advertise your own routes. To this end, you may need to use a [prefix list](../2.-Tutorial/2.3-Configuring-IP-routers/2.3.6-Configure-BGP-policies).

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Briefly explain 
what BGP communities you used for your peers, customers, and providers.
Then show a screenshot of one `in` and one `out` route-map
and briefly explain the different lines in the route-map.
Then, show that your configuration works properly by adding the result of the looking glass of your direct peer, which is supposed to show that this peer does receive the prefixes of
your customers, but does not receive the prefixes of your providers and peers.
Finally, use the `measurement` container to launch a `traceroute` from one of your providers towards one of your customers.

:exclamation: For groups that are connected to a Tier1 AS, instead of launching a `traceroute` from a provider towards one of your customers, launch the `traceroute` from a **peer** towards one of your customers (Tier1 ASes are not connected to the measurement container, so you can't launch `traceroute` from them). Make sure to start the `traceroute` from a peer that is supposed to send the traffic to you to reach your customer. For example, if you are AS 3, you can start the `traceroute` from AS 16 towards AS 6. However, if you launch it from AS 4 to AS 6, then the traffic might not go through your AS because of the implemented BGP policy in AS 4.
Note that you may only be able to run that `traceroute` after configuring the BGP session with the IXP (Question 3.2).

<!-- The targeted peer should be one that is reachable through the IXP (because to reach the directly connected peer, _e.g.,_ AS5 if you are AS6, the customer might use the direct link it has with it, _e.g.,_ the link between AS7 and AS5). For instance, if you are AS6, you should launch a `traceroute` from AS7 to AS103. 
Verify that your AS forwards the packet
directly to your peer and not to your provider. Include the result of the
`traceroute` in your report. -->


#### Question 3.2 (3 points)

By default, we have configured the IXPs to not relay your BGP advertisements to
their other peers. To announce a prefix to another peer via an IXP, you must
specify it using a BGP community value. IXPs are configured to relay a BGP advertisement
to a peer X if the advertisement has a community value equal to `N:X` with N the
IXP number. For example, if you are AS7 and you want to advertise a prefix
to AS16 via the IXP81, you must add the community value `81:16` in your BGP advertisements.

In this question, you must use the community values to send BGP advertisements to the peers connected to you through an IXP. However, for business reasons, you do **not** just want to peer with every other AS at the IXP.
You **do** want to peer through this
IXP with ASes that are located in another region. You **do not** want to peer through this IXP with ASes that are located in
the same region. To not peer through the IXP with ASes in the same region,
you must (i) not advertise them any prefixes and (ii) deny any advertisements
coming from them.

To check whether you properly configured (ii), we have configured
the stub ASes to advertise their prefix to all the ASes connected to their IXP.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Take a screenshot
of the relevant parts of the route-map at `BROO` used for eBGP session with your IXP
and explain what the different lines mean and do.
Show that the advertisement from the stub AS in the same region and
connected to the same IXP as you is denied by showing the result of a
`show ip bgp` in your router `BROO`.
For clarity, you do not need to write the full output, just the part that
is interesting (_i.e.,_ the part which could have the prefix of the stub AS).
Then, include in the report the output of the looking glass for the router `BROO`
of the stub AS in the same region and connected to the same IXP as you.
Then, include in your report the output of the looking glass for a group
in another region but connected to the IXP and which proves that your
prefix has been advertised through the IXP. When you include the output of a
looking glass in your report, only keep the parts that prove the correctness
of your configuration and omit the irrelevant ones.
Finally, use the measurement container to perform a `traceroute` from another AS (in another region)
to your AS for a destination where the traffic should go through the IXP.
Show the result in your report.

#### Question 3.3 (1.5 point)

In this question, the goal will be to configure your BGP policies in order to
influence the **inbound** traffic destined to your **own** prefix.
More precisely, your goal is to configure BGP policies such that the inbound traffic
coming from a provider and destined to your own prefix uses the provider connected
to `CHIC` in priority.

:pencil: **To include in your report:** Explain in a few sentences the
technique you used and discuss any potential drawbacks. Then, include the result of the
looking glass for both of your providers. You can omit parts of the output
that are irrelevant, and only show the part that shows that your configuration
is correct (_i.e.,_ the part where your own prefix is shown).
